# OI-Enfusion
an optimal interpolation–based framework (OI-EnFusion) was developed to combine spatial downscaling with spatio-temporal fusion for enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of LST products. 

In OI.py, the F represents the result of the spatio-temporal fusion (STARFM), and the O represents the result of the spatial downscaling (RF).
